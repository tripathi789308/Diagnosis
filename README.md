## Diagnosis - A simple disease predictor machine

It will ask various set of question about how user is feeling and give appropriate feedback.

Build in Python environment using tkinter library.
A very basic program to predict one's Diseases using Symptoms that one is feeling.

It will prompt four Options to every question, user has the freedom to choose any one or more of the options
that will help the program to predict next question or the disease one is suffering from.
I coded every possiblity that one can feed and make the program to decide what to do next.

It was just a try to achieve that was in my mind, feel free to give any feedback.
